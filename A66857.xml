            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down headlong, he burÅ¿t aÅ¿under in the middeÅ¿t, and his bowels guÅ¿hed out: Let this be the reward of the wicked from the Lord, and the Recompence of the PerÅ¿ecutor from the God of my Salvation; but the Righteous, let him be Å¿aved by the Lord, with an everlaÅ¿ting Salvation from my God, becauÅ¿e he is poor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿ed, and abhorred of men, and hath no deliverer in the earth.</p>

            <p>O Friends! I am a Lover of your Souls; and the eye is open, and opening daily in thouÅ¿ands, and a numerous number begin to Å¿ee the Å¿ad Å¿tate they have been long in: O the Lord hath done a wonder, and a marvellous work he hath wrought in this our day which is dawned, the Day-Star is riÅ¿en in the hearts of thouÅ¿ands, and the day that is everlaÅ¿ting is dawned, and in <hi>England</hi> the Å¿un is riÅ¿en that Å¿hall never Å¿et again; &amp; the light thereof Å¿hineth, &amp; Å¿hall Å¿hine more and more, untill the perfect day; which the Clouds of the evening, nor the Å¿haddow of the Mountains Å¿hall never cover again: the Lyon is rouzed, the BeaÅ¿ts of the field Å¿hall tremble; the Lord is working, and who Å¿hall hinder, or let him?</p>
            <p>The Light is the eye, which Å¿eeth this day, which was open in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in his Head who is inviÅ¿ible and eternall, who Å¿aith, <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi> This eye muÅ¿t be opened, and looked with, in you BiÅ¿hops; and the eye that doth offend and perÅ¿ecute the precious Life, phickt out, and caÅ¿t away, and the hand cut off, and the Right Arm of the wicked broken before the everlaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arm, which is under-neath, in which the Shepherd of <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi>

            <p>I Å¿ay, till this eye be opened, and a new tongue be unlooÅ¿ed, ye are but <hi>blind Watch-men</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> of the blind into the <hi>Ditch</hi> and <hi>horrible Pit;</hi> and <hi>Dumb Shepherds,</hi> that gather not the Sheep and out-caÅ¿t of <hi>IÅ¿rael;</hi> but Å¿uch as the Prophet Å¿peakes of, <hi>That fed themÅ¿elves with the fat and cloath with the fineÅ¿t of the wool, and bewrayed him that wandereth; ye gather not the out-caÅ¿t; but with force and cruelty Å¿catter the flock, which his own blood hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed.</hi>

            <p>The eye being blinded, that Å¿hould put a difference between the Precious and the Vile, the Sheep and the Goates, the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿ed and the Whole, the Strong, and the Weak: This is a great work. O Friends! to watch for the Å¿oul: The world by wiÅ¿dom, nor the learned by outward learning, know not the Å¿oul of man, nor what it is that the AnguiÅ¿h and pain is upon: but he that made it knoweth the frame thereof, and he that breathed into it the breath of Life, his eye, which is the Light, Å¿eeth and knoweth it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Å¿uch knowledge is too wonderful for me, that when this eye is awakened, I am Å¿atisfied therewith: O bleÅ¿Å¿ed is that eye that Å¿eeth and is Å¿atisfied therewith.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64060:7"/>Law;</hi> my anÅ¿wer is, if <hi>Haman</hi> were clear of the Jewes deÅ¿truction, (<hi>EÅ¿ther</hi> 3) ever the more, becauÅ¿e of the Kings Decree, and a Law made againÅ¿t them; then are you clear of our Å¿ufferings alÅ¿o: Why would you make us beleive <hi>the Word of a King</hi> is nothing worth, who hath promiÅ¿ed, <hi>We Å¿hould live in the liberty of a good ConÅ¿cience in his Dominions, Å¿o long as we lived peaceably,</hi> which hitherto we have, and ever Å¿hall do? for herein do we exerciÅ¿e our Å¿elves dayly, to have a ConÅ¿cience void of offence, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man: And if you harm us for that which is good, ChriÅ¿ts light in your conÅ¿cience will condemn you; but was not KING CHARLES miÅ¿-informed, as King <hi>AhaÅ¿huerus</hi> was, by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that Courtier, who told the King, <hi>the people of God were not fit to live in his Dominions?</hi> and are not we as greatly wronged by Å¿ome of you, as the Jewes were by <hi>Haman?</hi> ver 8. <hi>There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine people,</hi> Å¿aid Haman, <hi>Scattered and DiÅ¿perÅ¿ed among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in all the Provinces of thy Kingdom; and their Lawes</hi> (mark) [they did WoÅ¿hip another God] <hi>are divers from all people, neither keep they the Kings lawes,</hi> which was, <hi>that all Å¿hould bow to</hi> Haman; much like that law, <hi>That none Å¿hould meet together in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to WorÅ¿hip the Lord.</hi> And this is my caÅ¿e, who hath been a priÅ¿oner 18 weeks, nothing laid to my charge, but the keeping on my <hi>Hat</hi> to <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> [Å¿o called] whether Å¿uch thing ought to be Å¿uffered by the King, and his Councel, the Lord be Judge; Therefore, conÅ¿ider ye Judges, is this the way of the Judge of all the Earth? or the way to EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the Kings Throne? nay, the Lord Å¿ees it, and will plead our innocencie, who hath Å¿aid, <hi>The Kings Throne is EÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or could the Courtiers, pertaining to King <hi>Darius,</hi> be clear of <hi>Daniells</hi> being caÅ¿t into the Lyons Den, then you may be clear of Å¿o many thouÅ¿ands of us, being caÅ¿t into PriÅ¿ons, and Dens, as it is at this day. Read <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Then theÅ¿e PreÅ¿idents, and Princes, Å¿aid, We Å¿hall not find any occaÅ¿ion againÅ¿t this</hi> Daniel, <hi>except we find it againÅ¿t him, concerning the Law of his God. Then they came and told the King, The Governours and Princes, the Councellers and the Captaines have conÅ¿ulted together to EÅ¿tabliÅ¿h a Royal Statute, and to make a firm De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That whoÅ¿oever Å¿hall as any Petition of any God or Man, Å¿ave of thee, O King, for thirty dayes, he Å¿hall be caÅ¿t into the Den of Lyons. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King</hi> Darius <hi>Sealed the Writing, and the Decree:</hi> Now <hi>Daniel</hi> did not forbear worÅ¿hiping his God, as we do not forbear meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64060:8"/>becauÅ¿e of the Kings Decree, therefore came his Enemies and accuÅ¿ed <hi>Daniel,</hi> as our enemies accuÅ¿e us; that we are diÅ¿-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garders of the King, and his Law: Now, little did <hi>Darius</hi> know what deÅ¿igne theÅ¿e men did purÅ¿ue, that their envy was rather againÅ¿t <hi>Daniel,</hi> then to honour the King; though they did pretend it was for his honour, that they made Å¿uch a Royall Decree, as they called it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But when the King heard theÅ¿e things, how was he diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed with himÅ¿elf, and Å¿et his heart on</hi> Daniel <hi>to deliver him; and he laboured tell the going down of the Sun, to deliver him, but could not.</hi> Now let all Flatterers be warned, and Proud men take heed how they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenÅ¿e KING CHARLES againÅ¿t the Lords people, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deÅ¿troy them whom the Lord hath bleÅ¿Å¿ed; and let them know they are but men; and <hi>our God,</hi> whom we Å¿erve, and worÅ¿hip, notwithÅ¿tanding the Kings Command to the contrary, <hi>is the living and true God,</hi> and his Arm is not Å¿hortned, but he is the Å¿ame as ever he was in the dayes of <hi>Mordecay,</hi> EÅ¿ther 3. or in the dayes of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Daniel 6.22. And therefore, the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> Å¿hall not be conÅ¿umed, though they may Å¿uffer perÅ¿ecution many dayes, yet Å¿hall they not be forÅ¿aken: but out of all Tribulation Å¿hall the Lord deliver them, and Å¿ave them from the hand of the violent man.</p>
            <p>And now to your conÅ¿ideration, by whom we Å¿uffer, (whether as evil doers, or well doers, the Lord is Judge, and knoweth right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>well) I propound theÅ¿e few QueÅ¿tions in the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, <hi>Whether to obÅ¿erve Dayes, and Times, were not the Å¿in of</hi> ManaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, <hi>who filled JeruÅ¿alem with Innocent blood? and whether to Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on, Å¿poile our bodyes and goods, for opening our Å¿hops, and working on the Å¿ix dayes, be not contrary to the Command of God?</hi> which Å¿aith expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Six dayes Å¿halt thou labour, and do all thy work: and contrary to the ApoÅ¿tles Doctrine, which Å¿aith,</hi> I fear I have beÅ¿towed on you labour in vain, while ye obÅ¿erve Dayes, New-Moons, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Which were but a Shaddow of good things to come, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ChriÅ¿t?</hi> ColloÅ¿Å¿ians 2.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether it be not in your hearts, who are laying Å¿uch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for PerÅ¿ecution, to fill</hi> London, <hi>and the</hi> Nation <hi>with Innocent blood, as</hi> ManaÅ¿Å¿es <hi>did</hi> JeruÅ¿alem, <hi>if Å¿uffered by the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether ChriÅ¿t be the Light, that hath enlightened eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, or the Grace that hath appeared unto every man, and able to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64060:8"/>Å¿ave to the uttermoÅ¿t, able to Guide, Teach and Lead into all Truth, all that receive, and believe in it?</hi> If yea, <hi>Then whether all</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, Doctors, BiÅ¿hops, and Teachers <hi>whatÅ¿oever, that make it not there work to turn peoples minds to the light within, be not falÅ¿e Shepherds,</hi> and <hi>Å¿uch as</hi> Jeremy, <hi>EÅ¿ay, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Mied,</hi> cryed againÅ¿t, who Å¿aid, <hi>He was given for a Covenant of light, for a teacher and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his people, that he might be Salvation to the ends of the earth?</hi> IÅ¿a. 2.6, 7. IÅ¿a. 49.6, 9. Who alÅ¿o propheÅ¿ied, <hi>That the Nations which were Å¿aved, Å¿hould walke in the light of the Lord, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles Å¿hould come to his light, and Kings to the brightneÅ¿s of his RiÅ¿ing?</hi> IÅ¿a. 60.3. IÅ¿a. 2.5.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>And whether all Å¿uch</hi> BiÅ¿hops <hi>do not deny their work, and Å¿eek themÅ¿elves, and worry the flock of Christ, That Å¿et up any worÅ¿hip, (though they get a Law made by the powers of the Nation to establiÅ¿h it) if it be not in Spirit and truth only, and according to</hi> Pauls <hi>Doctrine and Work, which was</hi> to turn people from the darkneÅ¿s to the light, from the power of Satan unto God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. That remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins might be received, and an inheritance amongÅ¿t them that are Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in the light, in the Faith. <hi>Whether it be not a vain worÅ¿hip, being neither according to the Scriptures, nor you led thereunto by the Spirit of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>Whether all WorÅ¿hip, that is taken up from the letter of the Scripture,</hi> [Nothing differing to the outward act,] <hi>from the Saints of old, as Å¿inging</hi> Davids <hi>PÅ¿almes, Preaching and Praying, and the like, whether all this be not a vain worÅ¿hip, and to the Lord Abomination? Yea, or Nay.</hi> I Å¿ay, <hi>If not led thereto by the Eternall Spirit of the Lord?</hi> Seeing God is a Spirit, and they that worÅ¿hip him, muÅ¿t worÅ¿hip him in Spirit and Truth, as it is written, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>Whether they are like to do the work of an Evangelist, or perfect the Saints, or bring into the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nity of the Faith, or to any meaÅ¿ure of ChriÅ¿t, who are not in the Light, nor led by the Spirit, as it giveth utterance to them that Preach, Å¿eeing the Scripture Å¿aith, the true WorÅ¿hip</hi> is in Spirit, and <hi>the true MiniÅ¿ters</hi> Å¿pake as it gave them utterance? Acts 2.4. <hi>But are PerÅ¿ecuting and ImpriÅ¿oning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout dayes, the Children of the Light, who walk in the Å¿ubÅ¿tance, the Everla ting day, who Å¿aith,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>who is the Lord of the Sabboth, and the Word of the Oath, which was Å¿ince and before the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64060:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Seventhly, <hi>Whether this may not be for a</hi> Lamentation <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>that Å¿o many thouÅ¿and of the Lords people,</hi> (called Quakers) <hi>who have lived peaceably, Å¿ince they were a people, Å¿hould now be impriÅ¿oned, their bodies and goods Å¿poyled in Dungrons, Holes, and PriÅ¿ons, Å¿o Å¿oon after the</hi> Word of a King to the contrary, <hi>becauÅ¿e we cannot forÅ¿ake ChriÅ¿t in not meeting together, and break his Command, who is the Shepherd of his Sheep, and BiÅ¿hop of the Souls, and Å¿aith,</hi> Swear not at all? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33, 38. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12</p>
            <p>Now let all that Å¿ear the Lord, be Judge, whether this be diÅ¿obedience to MagiÅ¿trates, to be obedient to the Lord; and whether God be not rather to be obeyed than man, or any Commands or Lawes which are contra y to Scripture? And whether the Law was added to a Righteous man, or becauÅ¿e of the unrighteous and lawleÅ¿s? whether they that a e in ChriÅ¿t, and walk in, and Å¿pake the Truth, and do righteouÅ¿ly, and as they would be done unto; whether they do not fultil the RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of the Law? and what Law that is, will harm them in this condition.</p>
            <p>And now, O ye BiÅ¿hops, Doctors, and Teachers, and Rulers of the people, my love is to your immortal Å¿ouls, and iÅ¿Å¿ueth out towards you, becauÅ¿e of the Ruler of the people, whoÅ¿e love is in my heart: go not on to perÅ¿ecute an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people; cauÅ¿e them not to Å¿uffer, that never had any hand in your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which you, &amp; your King, are lately come out of: Å¿ince we were a people, we did never Plot, or do Violence to any Government, (but the government of Satan in the heart) and our Weapons were never Carnal Å¿ince we had a being, but Spiritual, to the pulling down of Å¿piritual wickedneÅ¿s; but in the Lord we have, and do honour all men, and Å¿ubmit to all their Righteous Commands, <hi>Who Rule for God, and are a Terror to evil doers, and PraiÅ¿e to them that do well;</hi> to them <hi>are our Å¿ouls Subject, and to their Commands, for the Lords Å¿ake;</hi> but as for theÅ¿e Commands, which are contrary to Scripture, and the Spirit of the Lord in our hearts, by Suffering, Å¿hall we rather chuÅ¿e to bear our TeÅ¿timony againÅ¿t, though commanded by a King, or Parliament; and if we Å¿uffer by them, it is for RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s Å¿ake; and not as Theives, Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or as evil doers; but as ChriÅ¿tians.</p>
            <p>And the living Lord is our <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and <hi>BiÅ¿hop,</hi> and with him have we peace, and good will towards men, Å¿uch as our PerÅ¿ecuters cannot take from us; elÅ¿e we Å¿hould have Å¿ainted before this day, had not we beleived in the Lord, who leads us, and inÅ¿truÅ¿ts as by his holy Å¿pirit in the path we Å¿hould go. And waters, and keeps us as the apple of his own eye, in patience under our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that we Å¿aint not in all our Tribulations; and this is my love, though I Å¿uffer for it: I leave it to the Lord, and his Eternal Councel, to you, do not lay a foundation for PerÅ¿ecution, though it be too much laid already, yet go not on; think not <hi>Sion</hi> will be built with blood, or JeruÅ¿alem upon the Ruin of the people, whom the Lord hath bleÅ¿Å¿ed, and choÅ¿en for his peculiar TreaÅ¿ure; for they are the bleÅ¿Å¿ed of the Lord, that made Heaven and Earth; and they that touch them will he rebuke for their Å¿akes, as he rebuked Kings in the dayes of old, Å¿aying, <hi>Touch not my anointed, and do my Prophets no harm,</hi> 1 Chron. 16.17, 22.</p>
